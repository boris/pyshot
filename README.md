# Py[thon Screen]shot
Motivation: I need to learn python, so in my first week started with a small
project that I already did in Ruby: A script to upload screenshots from
`/tmp/screenshots` to some public location (i.e. one of my servers).

**Setup**
```
sudo pip install pyinotify
```

**To Do**
- Daemonize
- Copy link to clipboard (xsel ?)
- Show notification on Ubuntu notification
- Make it a module?
